# Android Coding Challenge

hi ,, i didnt have enough time to work on UI ,, definitely dialog could be better 

i use MVVM Dagger RX i know i could do better , but i have only two day time on this project ( i was super busy on my current company )

so UI could be better ,, and api was weired i only had free sub so only i could get rates and for convertor i should do it my self ,,

i did my best about converting it could be better 

but i didnt have time so i skip the tests , sry about that 

wish u the best
